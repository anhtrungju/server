## üõ†Ô∏è How to, Instructions & Commands
The datapack usually just needs to be installed. There is nothing else you have to do. It just works out of the box.

But if you are playing on a PaperMC Server (or a PaperMC Fork like Purpur) make sure to set **allow-non-player-entities-on-scoreboards** in your paper config files to **true** in order for everything to work properly.

Some functionalities can be toggled on a per player basis. Meaning anyone playing can decide for themselves if they want to have the feature enabled or not. The folowing features can be toggled:

- Horse stats display: **/trigger horse_stats**
- Pet healing: **/trigger pet_healing**
- Region Level info: **/trigger region_info**
- right-click for dismounting villagers: **/trigger villager_dismount**
